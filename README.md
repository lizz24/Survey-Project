# Survey-Project

## What is a Survey? 
Surveys are a method of gathering information from individuals. Surveys have a variety of purposes, and can be conducted in many ways. Surveys may be conducted to gather information through a printed questionnaire, over the telephone, by mail, in person, by diskette, or on the web

## our main focus is going to be using the web format.

We are specifically going to create a form using html, css and javascript

## Make the survey as short as possible.
Focus on what's really important. What data do you need to make your argument, launch your campaign, or change a product? Extraneous, "good to know" questions bog down surveys and deaden their focus. Remember that your survey respondents don't really care about what is interesting to you or your company -- they care about how quickly they can finish the survey. 

**It's important to note that drop-offs happen more with longer surveys. What would your boss prefer: A nice and thorough survey with only 15 completed responses, or a shorter, tighter survey with 200 responses? Probably the latter.** 

If your survey is on the longer side, guide your respondents through the sections. Let them know what you're going to ask them. Give them cues when they're almost done ("In this last section, we're going to ask you …"). If your survey tool allows it (Google Forms does), show them a progress bar so they know how much of the survey is left. **And always thank them for taking the time to give feedback.**
